# NestJS Food Delivery Project

This project is a food delivery application built with NestJS, utilizing a microservices architecture with GraphQL.

## Project Structure

The project is set up as a monorepo with multiple applications:

- `gateway`: The main entry point of the application, handling API requests and routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- `users`: A microservice handling user-related operations.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in package.json)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ejay02/food_delivery.git
 
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables.

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode:

1. Start the users' microservice:

   ```
   npm run start:dev users
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the gateway:
   ```
   npm run start:dev gateway
   ```

The application should now be running and accessible.
